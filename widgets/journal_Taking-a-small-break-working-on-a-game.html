          It's been a bit since I updated the site, just taking a lil break,
          getting back into working on an RPG maker game I've had on hiatus for
          a bit.
          <br><br>
          I left this game for several months but recently picked up interest in
          it again, it's a remake of an old RPG maker 2000 built pokemon horror
          game, Pokemon Nightmare Invasion. I wanted to remake it for a few
          reasons, such as games from that engine are a bit borked on newer
          operating systems, and in general the original game is really cool,
          but the original game's combat system is considered terrible, it was
          ambitious for it's time, but just really didn't hold up too well.
          <br><br>
          In general, the game feels punishing to play, not due to player
          mistakes, but more due to RPG maker jank, which is rather infuriating,
          however, with the more recent engines comes plugins and active
          community support, and with the tools at my disposal, I feel I can
          remake, remaster, remakster the game and improve it.
