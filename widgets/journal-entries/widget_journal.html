          HEY...
          Soooooo...
          First REAL blog and not just a Lorem Ipsum
          <br><br>
          Topic: Old Deviantart user account deactivations
          <br><br>
          It's really sad going through the wayback machine and finding all artist
          accounts then going to their modern page and seeing it's just gone...
          all the lost art, all the lost memories, and it's not even just because
          of the Eclipse and WIX acquisition, just users leaving, weather it be one
          reason or another (accounts pre-2014 to some of the first days dA opened
          it's doors...).
          <br><br>
          It's heart breaking, not being able to see the art they made, which is
          now locked away in dA's storage never to be seen again (I mean, really
          dA stores it all, especially now with deleted comments being quote
          unquote"hidden". Damn dataset pricks...).
          <br><br>
          It hurts to see people you like gone, especially seeing this art in the
          the wayback machine where all you see is the thumbnail, but the page
          itself is just gone, just leaving that tiny frame of something that looks
          nice but you can't view it in full and appreciate it...
          <br><br>
          Ofc that being said, the artist that left had all the rights to deactive
          and leave, it's not really wrong for them to have done, but to just
          leave and basically wipe away their existance completely is just
          saddening for me personally.
          <br><br>
          Sometimes I wish I could find those artist again and just ask them if
          they are alright, just as a form of closure, to know they are at least
          doing well now. It's sad to see an artist just lose their passion for
          art, music, writing, crafts, etc etc... but if they are alright and still
          alive, then that's great to hear...
          <br><br>
          I wonder how often or if they ever just comeback, just to check on the
          site... Wonder how disappointed they are seeing how things have gone, not
          just for Deviantart, but for the internet in general...
